## Intro

The purpose of this little project is to add object tracking to yolov2 and achieve real-time multiple object tracking.

The current architecture is set to only track one type of objects, but it should be easy to generalise over all objects.

Currently support people tracking (as the provided weights for deep_sort were trained on people tracking)

## Dependencies

    python
    numpy
    opencv 3
    tensorflow 1.0
    Cython.
    sklean.

for using sort :

[`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

[`scikit-image`](http://scikit-image.org/download)

[`FilterPy`](https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy)


### Setup

1 - Clone this repository : `git clone https://github.com/bendidi/Tracking-with-darkflow.git`

2 - Initialize all submodules: `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3 - Go to darkflow directory and do in place build: `python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace`

## Getting started

Download the weights :

Read more about YOLO (in darknet) and download weight files [here](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/),In case the weight file cannot be found, [thtrieu](https://github.com/thtrieu) has uploaded some of his [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B1tW_VtY7onidEwyQ2FtQVplWEU), which include `yolo-full` and `yolo-tiny` of v1.0, `tiny-yolo-v1.1` of v1.1 and `yolo`, `tiny-yolo-voc` of v2.

The artchitecture I used/tested in this project is `cfg/yolo.cfg` with the weights `bin/yolo.weights`.

Next you need to download the deep_sort weights [here](https://owncloud.uni-koblenz.de/owncloud/s/f9JB0Jr7f3zzqs8?path=%2Fresources) (networks folder), provided by [nwojke](https://github.com/nwojke)

extract the folder and copy it to `deep_sort/resources`

Edit Flags in `run.py` following your configuration :

- `demo` : path to video file to use, set to "camera" if you wish to use your camera
- `model` : what model configuration to use for YOLO, you can get more information and .cfg files in [here](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)(put them in darkflow/cfg/ folder)
- `load` : The  corresponding weights to use with the chosen model (put them in darkflow/bin/) more info in [here](http://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/)
- `threshold` : the confidance threshold of the YOLO detections
- `gpu` : How much GPU to use, 0 means use cpu
- `track` : to activate tracking or Not
- `trackObj`: which objects to track as a list (notice that deep_sort's encoder was only trained on people , so you need train your own encoder, more information in [here](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort/issues/7))
- `saveVideo` : whether to save video or not
- `BK_MOG` : add opencv's MOG background subtraction module, only useful when YOLO can't detect people in a video (low quality, ...) use it to detect boxes around moving objects
- `tracker` : which tracker to use : "deep_sort" or "sort"

            **NOTE** : "deep_sort" only supports people tracking as it was only trained to track people(the code for training is not yet published)

            **TODO** : add support for GOTURN tracker(tensorflow implementation)

            **TODO** : add support for opencv trackers (MIL,KCF,TLD,MEDIANFLOW)

- `skip ` : skip frames to increase fps, might decrease accuracy !
- `csv` : save csv file of detections in the format (frame_id,object_id,x,y,w,h)
- `display` : display video while processing or Not

Next you just have to run `python run.py`, and enjoy !

## Some numbers :

`speed using yolo.cfg:

    YOLO with track Flag set to False : 30fps

    YOLO with track Flag set to True (deep_sort) : 14 fps

    YOLO with track and background subtraction Flags set to Ture : 10.5 fps

Tests done on (1024, 1280, 3) resolution video on Nvidia GTX 1080

skipping up to 3 frames allows for more speed up while keeping accuracy of tracking`
